**Nexus Gaja** is an intelligent, context-sensitive communication network designed to revolutionize global communication.

## Purpose and Vision
In a globalized world, language is often the biggest barrier. The main goal of Nexus Gaja is to enable seamless, barrier-free, and contextually accurate communication between people—regardless of whether they speak a common language.

It's not just about rigidly translating words, but about **transferring meaning**. Nexus Gaja connects people on a deeper level by understanding cultural, regional, and contextual nuances, thereby enabling genuine, authentic conversations.

## Possibilities and Features
- **Multimedia Communication**: The system processes not just text, but also image, audio, and video. This allows for fully immersive conversations (e.g., video calls or voice messages) in real-time across language barriers.
- **Context Sensitivity**: Recognition of irony, idioms, jargon, and regional dialects that are often misunderstood by conventional translators.
- **Cross-Platform Network**: Serves as a foundation for private chats, forum threads (posts with comments), and global community interactions.

## Technical Architecture (Core Concept)

The technical core of Nexus Gaja is a custom-built communication model that is strictly divided into three layers:

1. **Original**: The communication object (message) created by the sender always remains immutable.
2. **Semantic Interpretation**: The system analyzes not just the words, but the actual meaning.
3. **Target Language Representation**: The AI merely creates a temporary or cached representation of the original for the respective recipient based on their preferred language. Translations never overwrite the original message.

### Context Dependency
Translations in Nexus Gaja never view messages in isolation. The engine considers the entire hierarchy:
`Message` → `Previous Messages` → `Thread Context` → `Community Context` → `Language / Region` → `User Preferences`

### Efficiency through On-Demand Translation
Translation occurs resource-efficiently only **upon request** (On-Demand). When a user requests content, it is translated into their preset language. Once a translation for a specific language is generated, it is permanently stored (caching) to drastically accelerate future requests.

## Project Status
The project is currently in the active architecture and planning phase.
Ongoing architectural decisions are documented in the `/docs` folder.
